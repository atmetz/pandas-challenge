Files included:
PyCitySchool.ipynb
Resources/schools_complete.csv
Resources/students_copmlete.csv

Used PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb as base code.
I had help from TAs to debug issue in line:
district_summary = pd.DataFrame([{"Total Schools": school_count, "Total Students": student_count, "Total Budget": total_budget,
                                 "Average Math Score": average_math_score, "Average Reading Score": average_reading_score, "% Passed Math": passing_math_percentage,
                                 "% Passed Reading": passing_reading_percentage, "% Passed Overall": overall_passing_rate}])
